# Vendored Dependencies — DO NOT DELETE

This `node_modules/` directory is **committed to git intentionally**.

## Why these are vendored

The VS Code extension is a self-contained sub-project inside the backprop monorepo.
Its devDependencies (`@types/vscode`, `@types/node`, `typescript`) are checked in so
that the extension can compile and run without a separate install step.

Removing this directory will break the extension.

## Contents

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@types/vscode` | VS Code extension API type definitions |
| `@types/node` | Node.js type definitions |
| `typescript` | TypeScript compiler (used by `tsc -p ./`) |

## How they're protected

The root `.gitignore` has an explicit whitelist:

```
node_modules/
!vscode-extension/node_modules/
```

This ensures `node_modules/` is ignored everywhere else in the repo but
**preserved** here.

## Rules

- **Do NOT delete** this directory or any of its contents.
- **Do NOT add** `vscode-extension/node_modules/` to any `.gitignore`.
- **Do NOT run** `git clean` with flags that would remove tracked files here.
- If dependencies need updating, run `npm install` inside `vscode-extension/` and commit the result.
